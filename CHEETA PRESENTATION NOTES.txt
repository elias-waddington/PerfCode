Requirements
Climb at same profile to keep at same traffic pattern
Changes are made to make it better energy

WEIGHT ESTIMATE
As we cycle the aircraft, we can predict the detailed build-up from the other systems within about 1%. this gives us confidence that these tools are good enough. Allows us to do design studies without putting these subsystems as long lead items.
Further details will be discussed by subsystem teams

V00
As a result of low L/D we had a very high cruise power requirement at top of climb.

V01
We believe the fuselage weight is understimated. 
Investigating propulsor integration to investigate the BLI benefits.

V02
Peak motor power up due to improving efficiency estimations.

3-View
We fit the entire 737 fuselage - passengers, cargo, furnishings, everything, in that space

AERO
The approximate L/D and CL ranges during cruise

Load and Balance
Just considering the CG, we would move the wing 8 feet back. We still need to evaluate layout, S&C, routing, etc.
Effects of the 5 tanks. The passenger load has been simplified to 4 steps.

TOFL consideration
DEP affect aircraft configuration and sizing

Next Steps
Sizing conditions - discussed in later presentation, but we want to learn the impact of all of these on the overall a/c system
Lower altitudes - ride comfort and speed sacrifice


Questions
Punt question about LH2 in wings, "as we discussed as a team, the cylindrical tanks are more efficinet in terms of weight and volume and will be discussed further by that subteam.
